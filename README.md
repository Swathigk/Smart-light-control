## In this project, the programming was done using Text Mode inside Tinkercad. The coding language used is Arduino programming. Tinkercad also provides a Serial Monitor, which acts as a communication interface between the user and the Arduino microcontroller. Through the Serial Monitor, we can send commands like 1 and 0 to control the LED.The hardware components used in this project are: Arduino UNO R3, LED, 220-ohm resistor, Connecting wires. The resistor and LED are connected in series. The LED has two pins called anode and cathode. The anode is the positive terminal, and the cathode is the negative terminal. In the circuit, the anode of the LED is connected to one end of the resistor. The other end of the resistor is connected to digital pin 7 of the Arduino board. The cathode of the LED is connected to the GND pin of the Arduino. The resistor is used to limit the current so that the LED does not get damaged. In the coding part, pin 7 is set as an output pin. Serial communication is started with a baud rate of 9600. When the simulation is started, we open the Serial Monitor. If the user types 1 and presses enter, the LED turns ON. If the user types 0 and presses enter, the LED turns OFF. This works because the Arduino reads the input from the Serial Monitor and sets the output pin HIGH or LOW accordingly. This project shows how a simple light can be controlled using a microcontroller. Even though we are using Serial Monitor here, in real life this can be replaced with a mobile app or IoT platform. This makes it a basic example of a smart lighting system. This type of smart light control system can be used in many places. It can be used in home automation systems, where lights can be controlled remotely. It can also be used in smart classrooms, offices, and industries. In smart cities, similar systems are used to control street lights automatically. The main advantages of this project are that it is simple, cost-efficient, and easy to implement. It can also be integrated with IoT systems for remote control. This project helped me understand Arduino programming, serial communication, and basic circuit connections. Overall, this task gave me practical knowledge about how smart lighting systems work.
